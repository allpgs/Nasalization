# Nasalization

## Note of the author

Nasalization is an ultramodern sans serif typeface with a nod to the 1975 Nasa logo. In OpenType savvy applications, a slanted M and W will automatically flip or straighten out depending on neighboring characters. You can use the OpenType stylistic alternates feature to add a crossbar to the A. Nasalization is available in 6 weights and italics. The character set includes Greek, extended Cyrillic and covers almost every Latin-based language.

This font includes a license that allows free commercial use: sometimes referred to as a desktop license. This allows you to install the font on a computer and use it to create posters, web graphics, game graphics, t-shirts, videos, signs, ebooks, logos and more. Read the license agreement for details.

If you'd like to embed this font in an app, on the web or anything that's not covered by the desktop license agreement, visit the link below. You'll find distributors who offer different types of licenses, or you can contact me for help.
